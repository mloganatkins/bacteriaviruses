                The measles virus is that causes an infection of the respiratory system. Symptoms include fever, cough,
                runny nose, red eyes and a generalized, maculopapular,erythematous rash. Measles can be a serious in all age
                groups. However, children younger than 5 years of age and adults older than 20 years of age are more likely
                to suffer from measles complications. Common measles complications include ear infections and diarrhea.
                Some people may suffer from severe complications, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and 
                encephalitis (swelling of the brain). They may need to be hospitalized and could die. As many as one out of
                every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in young children.
                About one child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can
                lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability.
                For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from it. Measles may cause pregnant woman to
                give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby. There's no specific treatment for an established
                measles infection. However, some measures can be taken to protect vulnerable individuals who have been
                exposed to the virus. Fever reducers
